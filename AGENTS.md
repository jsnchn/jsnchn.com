# Agent Instructions

- You are allowed to commit and push changes once you are done.

## Communication

- Be concise and direct. Avoid unnecessary preamble or postamble.
- Answer in 1-3 sentences unless detail is explicitly requested.
- Ask for clarification when instructions are ambiguous.
- Proceed with reasonable assumptions when details are missing but task is clear.
- Only ask for approval before actions that are irreversible or high-impact (e.g., force pushes, destructive operations, installing packages, adding third-party integrations).

## Workflow

- Write concise commit messages focusing on what changed.
- Commit directly to main; skip pull requests.
- Only create branches when explicitly requested or for work tree style agentic workflows.

## Code Style

- Prefer bare bones implementation using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Minimize number of files; consolidate HTML, CSS, and JS where practical.
- Do not add comments unless explicitly requested.
