				<h1>Everyone Should Ride a Horse</h1>
				<p class="date">February 2026</p>

				<p>We live in an age of unparalleled convenience. Cars can take us anywhere faster than a horse ever could. We have airplanes that cross oceans in hours, not weeks. And yet, I stand by this statement: everyone should ride a horse. Not for transportation. For something far more important.</p>

				<p>When you sit on a horse, you become part of a relationship that predates the wheel, the engine, and the combustion. You're working with a creature that weighs half a ton and could crush you with a single misstep. And yet it allows you to direct it with your knees, your voice, your weight. That's not domination—that's communication. It's the closest thing to telepathy you'll ever experience.</p>

				<p>There's something humbling about being eight feet tall, looking down at a world built for people on foot, and realizing you're completely dependent on a thousand-pound animal's goodwill. Horses don't care about your title, your money, or your social media following. They care about whether you're calm, consistent, and fair. Ride with fear, and they'll know. Ride with arrogance, and they'll put you on the ground.</p>

				<p>In a world of screens and keyboards, horse riding demands your full attention. There's no multitasking on horseback. You feel every muscle shift, every breath, every moment of imbalance. It's mindfulness in its most physical form. The modern world is full of ways to disconnect from your body—horse riding forces you to reconnect.</p>

				<p>And there's the speed. Not the speed of a car, which isolates you from the world rushing past, but a slower speed that lets you actually see it. You notice the way birds scatter, the scent of hay from a distant barn, the warmth of the sun through the trees. It's travel as the pre-automobile world intended: present, aware, alive.</p>

				<p>I'm not saying abandon your car. I'm saying: find a stable, take a lesson, and let a horse change the way you see the world. Four legs really are better than four wheels.</p>
